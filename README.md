# From a Monolith to Microservices

In a previous exercise, we created a web service as a monolithic application in JavaScript with a database backend.
The goal for this project is to split it up into multiple microservices which contain at least (but are not limited to):
 - Users Service
 - XXX Service

The services will run on docker containers, which will be deployed using Kubernetes.
Additionally, we will build a CI pipeline using GitHub actions.
